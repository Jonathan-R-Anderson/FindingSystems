***This project is still ongoing and not all of the necessary code has been posted to the repository.***

What this project is attempting to do is to take social media data for sentiment analysis so that it may predict changes in the stock market based on the general sentiment the public feels regarding a particular industry or company. If you would like to contribute to the project please contact me first at jonathan.r.anderson@prontonmail.com.
